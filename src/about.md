I'm [Chris](http://becker.am).

I chose to document my 25th year alive on this planet with a 365 project, also
known as "a photo a day." [I've tried](https://www.flickr.com/photos/cbeck527/albums/72157632406445107)
to do one in the past, and got pretty far, but ended up giving up.

After watching my good friend [Ted Rysz](http://tedrysz3.com/) document his 25th
year [on instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BDW1Vx5DCay/?taken-by=tedrysz3),
I'm going to give it another try... this time on film.

Each day's picture will appear on the site when I get the roll developed. Expect
updates around once a month!
